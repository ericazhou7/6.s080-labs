The Manufacturing Process The Evolution Components and Construction of SKB Cases. The unique styling construction materials and engineering of SKB Cases were the result of many years of research and development by the principle owners of the company. Today Dave Sanderson and Steve Kottman run SKB Corporation s more than 550 employees in 3 manufacturing facilities around the clock in order to meet the global demands. Currently SKB manufactures cases for military industrial purposes the Music Pro Audio Industry and Sports Cases. - SKB Cases are manufactured of ultra-high molecular weight Polyethylene. This unique material was originally specified by the military for use in weapons cases due to the fact that it is impervious to solvents fuels or toxic liquids.

SKB cases have been on the road since 1977 and have spent a good deal of time flying equipment for military combat operations. These are tough cases built for a lifetime of service. The Manufacturing Process The Evolution Components and Construction of SKB Cases. The unique styling construction materials and engineering of SKB Cases were the result of many years of research and development by the principle owners of the company. Today Dave Sanderson and Steve Kottman run SKB Corporation s more than 550 employees in 3 manufacturing facilities around the clock in order to meet the global demands. Currently SKB manufactures cases for military industrial purposes the Music Pro Audio Industry and Sports Cases. - SKB Cases are manufactured of ultra-high molecular weight Polyethylene. This unique material was originally specified by the military for use in weapons cases due to the fact that it is impervious to solvents fuels or toxic liquids. It is essentially indestructible molds easily under heat and forms an impenetrable shield thereby protecting whatever it is contains. - SKB also utilizes aluminum valance material for its strength and lightweight characteristics on all closures with a special slot for a custom fitted Neoprene gasket that assists in sealing out moisture. SKB does all this valance bending in house to assure a perfect fit. - All riveting on SKB cases utilizes steel backing plates to prevent pulling through the plastic material. This is an SKB invention. This attention to detail is one of many factors that make SKB cases superior to all others. - Handles wheels D-rings exterior feet cam-action locking latches and butterfly clamps are all heavy duty variety and are also covered under the exclusive SKB Lifetime Warranty unless abused. Some of the handles and latches are manufactured by SKB from plastic regrind . Plus SKB has their own investment casting facility for making latches and hardware. li,3SKB-X2318-16,27.0,23.0 x 18.0 x 16.0 inches
